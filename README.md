# vim-symbolic
This tiny plugin provides a functionality similar to [vim-cute-python](https://github.com/ehamberg/vim-cute-python)
but without targeting a particular programming language. It's mainly for plaintext, but could be helpful in code.

You can toggle it with `:Symbolic`, changing

into

Using `:Symbolic!` instead will disable it rather than toggle.
